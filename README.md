# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

All the important parts of Exploratory Data Analysis is in the folder notebooks/exploratory.ipynb, so just run all the cells and check the outputs (everything for the task is inside the notebook).

Also inside the folder EDA_visualizations you can find all the visualizations from the notebook, but also the cleaned .csv documents without trash values. This could be useful for the future work.
